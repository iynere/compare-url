description: >
  Use the CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL created in the `reconstruct` command (or
  job) to do some parameterized logic/work. Designed to be run after the
  `reconstruct` command, or in a job downstream from the `reconstruct`
  job. Saves CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL value stored in file to a local
  environment variable and transforms it into a true commit range value
  (stored as a COMMIT_RANGE environment variable), ready to be utilized
  as desired.

parameters:
  step-name:
    type: string
    default: Evaluate/use CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL
    description: Specify a custom step name for this command, if desired

  attach-workspace:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      Attach a workspace for this command to use? Useful when this orb's
      `reconstruct` job is called upstream in a given workflow

  workspace-root:
    type: string
    default: "."
    description: >
      Workspace root path (either an absolute path or a path relative
      to the working directory), defaults to "." (the working directory)

  custom-logic:
    type: string
    default: echo "What should COMMIT_RANGE ($COMMIT_RANGE) be used for?"
    description: >
      What should be done with the commit information created by the
      `reconstruct` command/job? For an example, see the following:
