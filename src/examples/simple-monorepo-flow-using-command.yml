  Execute some action only for modified files from this commit.
  This example presupposes a monorepo of orbs, of which we only want
  to publish those with modifications. (See
  https://discuss.circleci.com/t/does-circleci-2-0-work-with-monorepos
  for details.)

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    compare-url: iynere/compare-url@x.y.z

  jobs:
    publish:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/circleci-cli
      steps:
        - checkout

        - compare-url/reconstruct

        - compare-url/use:
            step-name: Publish modified orbs
            shell-options: /bin/sh -ueo pipefail
            custom-logic: |
              for ORB in folder-containing-orb-subdirs/*/; do

                orbname=$(basename $ORB)

                if [[ $(git diff $COMMIT_RANGE --name-status | grep "$orbname") ]]; then

                  echo "publishing ${orbname}"

                  circleci orb publish ${ORB}/orb.yml namespace/${orbname}@version
                else
                  echo "${orbname} not modified; no need to publish"
                fi
              done
